# PYTHON BOOTCAMP 2021 T3 UNSW
This is my Github repository for a Python Bootcamp run by Dr. Rohitash Chandrash at UNSW between T2 and T3. The aim of the bootcamp is to practice coding skills in Python and use version-control software. You can view my coding samples in this repository, including a maze pathfinder, vending machine, BMI classifier and more.
